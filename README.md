# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Overview

The Work Day Scheduler presents a layout of hour time blocks from 9am to 5pm. The current date is listed at the top of the scheduler. The present hour will be highlighted in red, while the past will be in white and the future will be in green. 

A user can input scheduling information into the description area of each input then click the save button to the right. When the page is refreshed the inputted information will still appear until it is cleared out and re-saved.
